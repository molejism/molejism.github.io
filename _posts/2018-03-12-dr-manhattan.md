Which is your favourite superhero?

The best heroes are those that are not perfect, and their weaknesses define them, and they have to
overcome them. Apparently, the weakness of Dr Manhattan from watchmen is that, as time progresses,
he is more and more disconnected from humanity. I love that joke.

One of my favourite scenes in watchmen is when he and some clones are in bed with his girlfriend.
She gets mad because she believes that the Dr is not paying his whole attention at her, given that
some other clones are working. Oh boy, I know some people will disagree with me, but I completely
support the Dr and I would do the same as he does.

The point of having him as superhero is precisely to show how irrational people can behave. She
doesn't have any idea of the capabilities of the Dr. Come on, he learned to assemble himself. Of
course that is impossible, but if you are in the setting, you have to agree that the Dr is not human
anymore. He is on the next level of consciousness and knowledge.

But hold tight, he is willing to talk about the situation if she thinks his behaviour was wrong. And
she just leaves without listening! I mean, the wisest being on earth is telling you that he accepts
that he might be wrong and willing to apologize and change, and you just leave annoyed! He is
probably the one that less mistakes can do, and even there he knows there might be room for
improvement.

Of course this scene is an expression of her overwhelming feelings, but that exactly my point:
humans are shamingly overwhelmable by feelings, overriding any sense of sensibleness, perspective
and humbleness.

It's so obvious to me that she is the mistaken one that it embarrasses me just to think how common
it would be for people to side with her. And she doesn't even seem to consider the possibility that
she is the mistaken one. ((!) Of course. How could it be that she is wrong against the smartest
being? That's ridiculous, and it's not enough that she has the right to win the discussion, she has
the right to not stand the conversation and the right to be angry with him, because a mistake was
done innocently by a person that loves her (!)).
